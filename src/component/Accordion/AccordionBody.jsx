            <p>
              React is a JavaScript library for rendering the user interface.
              React JS divides the user interface into reusable pieces called
              components. <br /> React includes virtual DOM, which make a
              website more interactive. When there is a change in our website,
              instead of rendering the entire website, it compares the virtual
              dom with what has changed and only renders the changed part and
              shows it to the user.

        <Accordion
          question={"Difference between props vs state."}
          answer={
            <p>
              Both props and state are used to manage data in React, but they
              are used in different ways for different reasons. <br />
              <strong className="underline">Properties(props):</strong> Props
              are used to send data from the parent component to the child
              component. Passing data cannot change child components, because
              they are immutable Props can be used to pass any type of data,
              including strings, numbers, objects, and functions. <br />
              <strong className="underline">State:</strong> A state is an object
              that executes asynchronously. It is used to keep track of data
              that may change over time. When state is updated, React will
              re-render the component and any child components that depend on
              the changed state. State is mutable and can be changed by the
              component itself.

        <Accordion
          question={"How does useState work?"}
          answer={
            <p>
              In React's <strong>useState()</strong> is a hook, that is used to
              manage state in functional components. It returns an array
              containing two values, the current state and a function that will
              change the state. When the state is updated using the update
              function, React will automatically re-render the component with
              the updated state.

        <Accordion
          question={"Purpose of useEffect other than fetching data."}
          answer={
            <p>
              <strong> useEffect()</strong> is usually used to fetch the data.
              Besides, useEffect in react js allows performing side effects in
              our components. The react useEffect examples of side effects
              include reading from local storage, retrieving data, direct DOM
              updates, and timers.
